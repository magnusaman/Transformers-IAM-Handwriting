- **Minimum**: -1px (32 anomalous entries with -1 values)
- **Maximum**: 1,934px
- **Mean**: 164.2px
- **Median**: 142.0px
- **Standard Deviation**: ~108.5px

#### Height Statistics
- **Minimum**: -1px (32 anomalous entries)
- **Maximum**: 308px
- **Mean**: 72.3px
- **Median**: 69.0px
- **Standard Deviation**: ~25.8px

#### Aspect Ratio (Width/Height)
- **Mean**: 2.30
- **Median**: 1.96
- **Interpretation**: Words are typically ~2x wider than tall, which is expected for horizontal text

### Graylevel Threshold Analysis
- **Range**: 135 - 216
- **Mean**: 175.38
- **Median**: 176.0
- **Most common**: 182 (5,033 occurrences)

**Purpose**: These values indicate the optimal threshold for binarizing each word image.

## 6. Data Quality Issues & Anomalies

### Issue 1: Segmentation Errors (14.04%)
- **Count**: 6,259 words marked as "err"
- **Impact**: May contain poorly segmented word boundaries
- **Recommendation**:
  - Use only "ok" samples for initial training
  - Include "err" samples in later stages for robustness
  - Visually inspect error samples for patterns

### Issue 2: Anomalous Dimensions
- **Count**: 32 entries with -1 values for all bounding box coordinates
- **Examples**:
  - `a01-030-01-04 err 176 -1 -1 -1 -1 IN at`
  - `a01-030-05-09 err 176 -1 -1 -1 -1 , ,`
- **Status**: Most are "err" but some are marked "ok"
- **Recommendation**:
  - Filter out these 32 samples (0.07% of dataset)
  - These likely represent failed segmentation with no valid bounding box

### Issue 3: Extreme Dimensions
- **Very large widths**: Up to 1,934px (likely long words or phrases)
- **Very large heights**: Up to 308px (unusually tall for word images)
- **Recommendation**:
  - Review outliers beyond 3 standard deviations
  - May need special handling during preprocessing

1. **"A"** - Single letter, cursive style
2. **"MOVE"** - All caps word
3. **"Mr."** - Abbreviated word with punctuation

Images show natural handwriting variation with different:
- Writing styles (cursive, print, mixed)
- Sizes and aspect ratios
- Ink intensity and stroke thickness
- Baseline angles and slant

## 10. Recommendations for Machine Learning

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Filter anomalies**: Remove 32 samples with -1 dimensions
2. **Normalize images**:
   - Use provided graylevel thresholds for binarization
   - Resize to consistent dimensions (consider median: 142x69)
   - Apply padding to maintain aspect ratios
3. **Handle segmentation errors**: Train separate models or use data augmentation

### Train/Val/Test Split
- **Recommended**: 70/15/15 split
- **Strategy**: Stratify by writer to ensure balanced representation
- **Consider**: Form-level splits to avoid data leakage (same form in train/test)

### Data Augmentation
- Rotation: ±5-10 degrees
- Elastic deformation
- Random noise
- Stroke width variation
- Avoid: Horizontal flipping (breaks text directionality)

### Model Architecture Suggestions
- **CNN-RNN**: For sequence modeling (LSTM/GRU)
- **Transformers**: Vision Transformers or BERT-style models
- **CTC Loss**: For variable-length output
- **Attention mechanisms**: For better character alignment
